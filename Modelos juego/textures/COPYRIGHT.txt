All texture files are published under the terms of the GNU GPL.

Here you can find sources of the files - or most of them (we'll probably forget to
add newly added files here. mail boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net if a file is
missing here).
Some files were under a less restrictive license (meaning: it allows
re-licensing) or even under the public domain. They got relicensed by us. Feel
free to use either the original license or the GPL. If the files were modified
by us you *have* to use GPL (or mail us:)).

Some files are from golgotha - which was developed by crack.com, but never
finished and then released to the public domain. You can find the original files
here: http://jonathanclark.com/golgotha/browse.html
They were *really* released as public domain - meaning you can do just
everything with it - relicense, sell, use, ...

UPDATE: you can't find the sources for every file anymore, because I had to
rename them from golgotha-filenames (which i've used) to the filenames our
artist uses. its way too much work for me to keep track of the actual content
and source of these files. please contact our artist or
boson-devel@lists.sourceforge.net for the actual source of the files.
